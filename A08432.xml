            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Diuell, being the principall agent and chiefe practiser in all wickednes. It is much to the purpose we haue in hand, to describe and set him forth, that we may the better be instructed to see what he is able to doe in what manner, and to what end and purpose. At the beginning (as Gods word doth teach vs) he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an holy Angell, full of power &amp; glory. He sinned, he was cast downe from heauen, he was vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of glory, and preserued for iudgement. This therefore, and this change of his, did not destroy nor take away the former facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Diuels, but vtterly corrupt, peruert, and depraue the same. The Essence of Spirits remained, and the power and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding such as is in Angels. The heauenly Angels are very migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and strong, far aboue all earthly creatures in the world. The Infernall Angels are for their strength called Principalities and Powers. Those blessed ones apply all their might to set vp and aduance the glory of God, and to defend and succour his children. The Diuels bend all their force against God, against his glory,<note place="margin">Eph. <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1+ letters">

Hee hath such power and authority that he is called the God of the World. His kingdome is bound and inclosed within certaine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, for he is the Prince, but of Darknes. But yet within his said dominion (which is in ignorance of God) he exerciseth a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tyranny. Our Sauiour compareth him to a strong Man, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med which keepeth his Castle.</p>
            <p>And what shall we say, for the wisedome, <hi>and vnderstanding of Angells,</hi> which was giuen them in their Creation, was it not far aboue that which Men can reach vnto? When they became Diuels (euen those reprobate Angels) their vnderstanding was not taken away, but turned into malitious craft, and subtilty. He neuer doth any thing but of an euill purpose, and yet he can set such a colour, that the Apostle saith, <hi>He doth change himselfe into the likenesse of an Angell of Light.</hi> For the same cause he is called <hi>the old Serpent.</hi> He was subtill at the beginning, but continuall practise, and long experience, hath made him much more subtill. He hath searched out, and knoweth all the waies that may be to deceiue. So that if God should not chaine him vp his power and subtilty (ioyned together) would ouercome, and seduce the whole world.</p>
            <p>There be great multitudes of Infernall Spirits as the holy Scriptures doe euery where shew, but yet they doe so ioyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one, that they be called the Diuell in the singular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. They doe all ioyne together (as our Sauiour teacheth) to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold one kingdome For though they cannot loue one another, in deed, yet the hatred they beare against God, is as a band, that doth tis them together. The holy Angels are ministring Spirits. sent forth for their sakes that shall inherit the promise. They haue no bodily shape of themselues: But to set forth their speedines, the Scripture applieth it vnto our rude capacity, and painteth them out with wings. When they are to rescue, and succour the seruants of God, they can straight way from the highest heauens
<pb facs="tcp:10799:3"/> (which are thousand of thousands of miles distant from the earth) be present with them.</p>
            <p>Such quicknesse is also in the Diuels: for their nature being spirituall, and not loden with any heauenly matter as our bodies are, doth afford vnto them such a nimblenesse as we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. By this they fly through the world, ouer sea, and land, and spy out all aduantages, and occasions to doe euill.</p>
            <p>To declare what these malignant Spirits haue effected, and brought to passe or what successe they haue attained, would be too long and tedious a p√©ece of worke. I will therefore loose that point of my compasse, and saile forwards in my intended way, to finde out and declare the fearefull vexation of one <hi>Alexander Nyndge,</hi> who was grieuously tormented with an euil Spirit from the xx. of Ianuary, to the 23. of Iuly, and is worthy to be remembred both for example, and warning. For describing the horror and vnheard of misery that fell vpon him, we may be thereby drawne to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into our selues, and to looke into our soules betimes, least Heauen powre downe the viols of wrath vpon vs.</p>
            <p>You shall vnderstand therefore that the first fit, and vexation, wherewith this <hi>Alexander Nyndge</hi> was so fearefully perplexed began about seauen of the clocke at night. His Father, mother, and brethren, with the residue of the houshold being at that time in presence. And it was in this manner. His chest, and body fell a swelling, his eies a staring, and his backe bending inwards to his belly which did strike the beholders into a strange wonder, and admiration at the first, yet one of his brothers then also present, named <hi>Edward Nyndge,</hi> a Master of Arts, being boulder then others were of the company, certainly perswading himselfe that it was some euill spirit, that so molested him: gaue him comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble words of mercy from the holy Scriptures, and also charged the Spirit by the death and Passion of Iesus Christ, that it should declard the cause of that torment. At which the countenance of the same <hi>Alexander</hi> turned more strange, and full of amazement, and feare then it was before, and so returned to his former state againe.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Alexander Nyndge</hi> hauing his sp√©ech thou at liberty
<pb facs="tcp:10799:4"/> said vnto the same <hi>Edward,</hi> Brother, he is maruellous afraid of you, therefore I pray you stand by me.</p>
            <p>With which words the same <hi>Edward</hi> was the more bold, and said to <hi>Alexander,</hi> If thou dost earnestly repent thee of thy sins, and pray to God for the forgiuenesse of the same, (my life for thine) the Diu<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ll cannot hurt th√©e, No, rather then he should, I will goe to hell with thee. Then the Spirit (for a small time) racked the said <hi>Alexander</hi> in a far more cruell manner: for he did vse such strange and idle kinds of gestures in laughing, dancing, and such like light behauiours, that he was suspected to be mad: sundry times he refused all kinds of meat for a long space together, insomuch as he s√©emed to pine away. Sometimes he shaked as if he had had an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue. There was heard also a strange noise or flapping from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his body, Hee would gather himselfe on a round heape vnder his bedcloathes, and being so gathered, he would bounse vp a good height from the bed, and beat his head and other parts of his body against the ground, and bed-stead in such earnest manner, that the beholders did feare that he would thereby haue spoiled himselfe, if they had not by strong hand restrained him, and yet thereby he receiued no hurt at all.</p>
            <p>In most of his fits he did swell in his body, and in some of them did so greatly exc√©ed therein, as he seemed to be twice so big as his naturall body. He was often seene to haue a certaine swelling or variable lumpe to a great bignesse swiftly running vp and downe between the flesh and the skin.</p>
            <p>Then would they carry the same <hi>Alexander</hi> downe the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, willing him to call vpon God for grace, and earnestly to repent him, and to put his trust only in Christ Iesus. And setting him in a chaire, desired his Father to send for all his neighbors, to helpe to pray for him. And on a suddaine he would be strangely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for (sitting in a chaire when the fit came) he would be cast head long vpon the ground, or fall downe, drawing then his lips awry, gnashing with his t√©eth, wallowing and foming, and the Spirit would vexe him monstrously and transforme his body, and alter the same by many violences. Then the said <hi>Edward</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with one <hi>Thomas Wakefield</hi> would lay hands on <hi>Alexander</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:10799:4"/> and set him in the Chaire againe, and there hold him. All that were in the house praying earnestly.</p>
            <p>And the said <hi>Edward</hi> charging the Spirit with these words, <hi>Thou fowle Feind, I Coniure thee, in the name of Iesus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, the Sonne of Almighty God, that thou speake vnto vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereat the Spirit transformed him very vgly against his Chest, swelling vpwards to his throat, plucking his belly iust to his backe, and so ceased for a time.</p>
            <p>The partie tormented being somewhat restored, vttered these words; <hi>Sirs, He will speake with me, I pray you let him not speake with mee.</hi> Whereupon all that were present did pray earnestly, at which the Spirit began to vexe him very grieuously and swelled sore <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>m? Why didst thou tell them?</hi> Then the said <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> did Charge the Spirit (as aforesaid) to tell them the cause of his comming? And why hee did torment his brother. To the which the Spirit answered. <hi>I come for his Soule.</hi> Then the saide <hi>Edward</hi> said vnto the Spirit, <hi>Wee haue a warrant in the holy Scriptures, that such as doe earnestly repeat them of their sins, and turne vnto God with the only hope of Saluation, through the merits of Iesus Christ, thou mayest not haue them, for Christ is his Redeemer.</hi> The Spirit vttered (in a base hollow soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding voyce) these words, <hi>Christ that was my Redeemer.</hi> Then <hi>Edward</hi> said, <hi>Christ that is his Redeemer, not thy Redeemer, but my brother <hi>Alexander</hi> his Redeemer.</hi>
            </p>

And the Spirit said, <hi>Aubon, Aubon.</hi> They charged him then (as is aforesaid) to make knowne vnto them whence hee came: and the Spirit made answere in a hollow voyce; <hi>From Ireland, from Ireland.</hi> Then they laide the fourth Chapter of Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> against him, where Christ said, It is; <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue.</hi> Which Sentence, as it was pronounced, the hollow voyce sounded, <hi>My Master, my Master, I am his Disciple, I am his Disciple.</hi> Then they answered, <hi>Thy Master we graunt he is, but thou lyest, thou art none of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. Thou art onely an instrument, and scourge to punish the wicked, so farre as pleaseth him.</hi> And then they layd vnto him the eight Chapter of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> whereas Christ himselfe did cast out Deuils. And the Spirit answered hollowly, <hi>Baw-wawe, baw-wawe.</hi> And within a little space after, the body of the saide <hi>Alexander,</hi> being as monstrously transformed as it was before, much like the picture of the Deuill in a play, with an horrible roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring voyce, sounding <hi>Hell-hound,</hi> was most horribly tormented. And they that were present fell to prayer, desiring God earnestly to take away the foule Spirit from him. The said <hi>Edward</hi> then desired to haue the window opened, for, <hi>I trust in God</hi> (said hee) <hi>the fowle Spirit is wearie of our company.</hi> The windowes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened accordingly, within two Minuts after the tormented body returned to true shape againe, the said <hi>Alexander</hi> leaping vp, and holding vp his hands, and saying, <hi>Hee is gone, he is gone, Lord I thanke thee.</hi> Whereat all the people that were then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent fell downe on their knees with the reuerence, and yeelded vnto God exceeding praise and thanksgiuing. This fit ended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eleuen of the Clocke the same night, and so they went to Supper with great ioy and gladnesse.</p>
            <p>After foure a clocke in the Morning another fit began: and the said <hi>Alexander</hi> being in his bed, with great trembling said, <hi>I will goe, I will goe.</hi> Then said <hi>Edward, Brother, call your selfe to

This fit continuing halfe an houre, and somewhat more, they tooke him the Bible to read, and so fell to godly Prayer against all assaults and temptations in this maner.</p>
